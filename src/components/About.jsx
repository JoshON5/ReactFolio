          I  am a web developer  from the full-stack UTSA
          Bootcamp program and growing steadily in my knowledge of coding
          languages and techniques day to day. I have found that I have been
          utilizing coding principles my whole life through the hobbies I
          enjoy. My joy of cooking is like building of a
          code with the right syntax, both utilizing understanding of techniques combined with creativity, while my enjoyment of trivia and puzzles
          have helped develop the mindset of recalling information and debugging
          errors.
